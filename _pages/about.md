# About me
---

I am a Ph.D. candidate at robotics institute of the Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. My research focuses on visual localization and mapping of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), and SLAM. 

As the team leader, I have won champion in several national UAV competitions. Thus, I am proficient in the full range of technologies involved in the mechanical design of drones, hardware circuit, perception and localization, as well as planning and control processes. 

I am also experienced in UAV autonomous industrial inspection. I am fully responsible for visual aerial inspection with ZPMC, and power line contact-inspection with State Grid.

- ## Real-time Cross-camera Feature Association for Relative Pose Estimation of UAVs

  This work aims to estimate relative pose between two UAVs with common environmental features. we propose a high-rate cross-camera feature association with a dual-channel structure. Then, we develop a Multi-State Constrained Kalman Filter (MSCKF) to estimate relative pose of UAVs. 

  **This work has been revised by IEEE RAL with encouragement. We have revised and submited. Waiting for publishing soon!**

- ## Robust Visual Positioning of the UAV for the Under Bridge Inspection With a Ground Guided Vehicle

  For regular defect inspection of the bridge’s bottom. we design a ground–air mobile system and a dual-source positioning algorithm to enhance the robustness of the UAV’s positioning.

  **This work has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement 2022 !**

- ## Semantic Visual-Inertial Odometry for Paticle-based Mapping in Dynamic Enviroment
  we propose a particle-based instance-aware semantic occupancy mapping in dynamic environments. 
  I design a semantic VIO algorithm based on OpenVINS, supporting both tracking moving objects and self-localization in dynamic environment.

- ## Visual-Inertial Odometry with Omni Fisheye Cameras

  I design a visual-inertial odometry with four fisheye cameras (220 degrees) as follows. The SuperPoint is for multi-UAV cross-camera feature matching. The Fast corner is extracted with grid spaces. Then LK optical flow are used for local feature association.
