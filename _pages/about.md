- ## Multi-UAV Collaborative Long-distance Mapping
  
  Leveraging multiple cameras on multiple UAVs to build a wide-baseline collaborative stereo camera are promising for remote mapping.

- ## Real-time Cross-camera Feature Association for Relative Pose Estimation of UAVs

  This work aims to estimate relative pose between two UAVs with common environmental features. we propose a high-rate cross-camera feature association with a dual-channel structure. Then, we develop a Multi-State Constrained Kalman Filter (MSCKF) to estimate relative pose of UAVs. 

  **This work has been revised by RAL with encouragement. We have revised and submited. Waiting for publishing soon!**

- ## Robust Visual Positioning of the UAV for the Under Bridge Inspection With a Ground Guided Vehicle

  For regular defect inspection of the bridge’s bottom. we design a ground–air mobile system and a dual-source positioning algorithm to enhance the robustness of the UAV’s positioning.

  **This work has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement 2022 !**

# National Competition
---
- ## National Intellegent Autonomous Navigation UAV Competition
  This competition requires UAV detecting circles, and planning its trajectory to avoid obstacles. As the team leader, we won the champion in 2021.

- ## National High-speed UAV Tracking Competition
  This competition requires UAV accurately tracking the target carried by a high-speed car. I am the first person in charge to build the hexcoptor, develop visual servo tracking, state fusion, and feedback control. We won the excellent prize in 2020.

- ## Visual-Inertial Odometry with Omni Fisheye Cameras

  I design a visual-inertial odometry with four fisheye cameras (220 degrees) as follows. The SuperPoint is for multi-UAV cross-camera feature matching. The Fast corner is extracted with grid spaces. Then LK optical flow are used for local feature association.

- ## Visual-Inertial Odometry in dynamic Enviroment

  I design a VIO algorithm based on OpenVINS, which applied for dynamic environment. The dynamic and static feature classifed semantic network.
